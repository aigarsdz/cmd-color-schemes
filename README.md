# cmd-color-schemes

A collection with color schemes for Windows CMD app.

**Important.** Since Microsoft announced that CMD will be replaced with PowerShell, there is really no reason to continue this little project. You can port color schemes to PowerShell in a similar but slightly more complicated way, but I have no plans to do that. Instead I switched to [Hyper](https://hyper.is "Hyper - A terminal built on web technologies"), which is easily extendable with themes and plugins and runs great on Windows and MacOS. Check it out if you haven't yet!
